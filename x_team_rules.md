# X-Team 20 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
* 1. Tasks are to be assigned on a requested basis at first.
   * 1a. If a team member has a specific preference (and they are experienced in that area) they can request to complete that part of         the project.
  
* 2. Tasks left unrequested will be divided between the group members. 
    * 2a. The number of tasks assigned will attempt to distribute difficulty and work-load evenly.
