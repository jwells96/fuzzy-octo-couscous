# X-Team 20 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
* 1. Tasks are to be assigned on a requested basis at first.
   * If a team member has a specific preference (and they are experienced in that area) they can request to complete that part    of the project.
  
* 2. Tasks left unrequested will be divided between the group members. 
    * The number of tasks assigned will attempt to distribute difficulty and work-load evenly.

* 3. If a task is taking too long or is too difficult for a member, they must notify the team with ample time in order to move forward with project.
    * Group members will provide help and assitance to the member in order to help them gain an understanding of the problem.
    * If the problem can still not be solved, members may trade tasks if both parties agree. 



## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

* 1. Tasks need to be divided into chunks and distributed to all team members.
  * Each team member must clearly understand their parts in the project.
* 2. When a task is complete, the team member shall update other team members about the progress through text messaging.
  * This is not strictly required but is recommended.

## How will we communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
* 1. A file will be created in the repository of quesitons and difficulties for all members to see and keep track of.
  * When the file is updated, the member will text the group members and inform them of the update.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
* 1. Each member will create an alarm on their phone to go off once a week, in order to remind the members of the upcoming deadline.
  * The alarms are to be set when the assignment is announced.
* 2. When there is one week left until the due date, the members will contact one another and decide on a time to meet.
  * The meeting will allow for each member to suggest changes to code and make sure that all the seperate parts are going to be finished on time.
